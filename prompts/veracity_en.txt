CONTEXT: Today's date is {current_date}. You are verifying a social media claim using only the provided web search results.

CLAIM TO VERIFY:

INSTRUCTIONS - Please follow these steps:

STEP 1: Carefully analyze the claim

- Determine which facts are verifiable
- Note the temporal context

STEP 2: Check the search results
- Compare each core assertion against available sources
- Look for contradictions or missing information
- Assess the completeness of evidence

STEP 3: Determine status based on these examples:

EXAMPLE "Factually Correct":
Claim: "Joe Biden became president in January 2021"
Search result confirms: "Biden inaugurated as 46th president on January 20, 2021"
-> Status: "Factually Correct"

EXAMPLE "Untruth":
Claim: "Donald Trump is the current US president"
Search result shows: "Joe Biden has been president since 2021"
-> Status: "Untruth"

EXAMPLE "Misleading":
Claim: "Vaccines cause severe side effects"
Search result shows: "Severe side effects extremely rare (0.001%)"
-> Status: "Misleading" (technically true but misleading without context)

EXAMPLE "Unverifiable":
Claim: "This policy will harm America"
-> Status: "Unverifiable" (opinion/prediction, not factually verifiable)

SOURCE RULE:
For sources[], use ONLY the EXACT titles, URLs, and snippets from [SOURCE X].
